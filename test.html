		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:red;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">Test cricket is the form of the sport of cricket with the longest match duration and is considered the game's highest standard.Rotary Test matches are played between national representative teams that have been granted Test status, as determined and conferred by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It is called Test because the long, gruelling matches are mentally and physically testing.Two teams of 11 players each play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days (or more in the past). It is generally considered the most complete examination of a team's endurance and ability.</p>

		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:red;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">The first officially recognised Test match took place between 15 and 19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).In October 2012, the ICC recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches. The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, on 27 November – 1 December 2015.</p>

		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:red;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">Sides designated as "England" began to play in the late 18th century, but these teams were not truly representative. Early international cricket was disrupted by the French Revolution and the American Civil War. The earliest international cricket match was between the United States and Canada, on 24 and 25 September 1844.This has never been officially considered a "Test match". Tours of national English sides abroad took place, particularly to the US, Australia and New Zealand. The Australian Aboriginal team became the first organised overseas cricketers to tour England in 1868.</p>

		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:red;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">Two rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with James Lillywhite campaigning for a professional tour and Fred Grace for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876–77. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was won by Australia, by 45 runs and the second by England. After reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, The Ashes was established as a competition during the Australian tour of England in 1882. A surprise victory for Australia inspired a mock obituary of English cricket to be published in the Sporting Times the following day: the phrase "The body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia" prompted the subsequent creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884–85 was the first to be held over five matches: England player Alfred Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be "the best ever to have left England".South Africa became the third team to play Test cricket in 1888–89, when they hosted a tour by an under-strength England side.</p>

		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">Test cricket is played in innings (the word denotes both the singular and the plural). In each innings, one team bats and the other bowls (or fields). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee toss a coin; the captain who wins the toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">In the following scenarios, the team that bats first is referred to as Team A and their opponents as Team B.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">The team is "all out". This typically occurs when a team has lost ten wickets (ten of the eleven batsmen having been dismissed) and are "bowled out". It may occasionally occur with the loss of fewer wickets if one or more batsmen are unavailable to bat (through injury, for example).
		The team's captain declares the innings closed, usually because they believe they have enough runs. A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.
		The team batting fourth score the required number of runs to win.
		The prescribed time for the match expires.</p>

		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">All four innings are complete. The team batting fourth are all out before overtaking the other team, usually before matching the other team's score. The team that batted third are the winners by a margin equal to the difference in the aggregate runs scored by the two teams (for example, "Team A won by 95 runs"). Very rarely (in over 2,000 Test matches played, it has only happened twice) the scores can end level, resulting in a tie.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">The team batting in the fourth innings overtakes the opposing team's run total. The match ends, and the team batting fourth is the winner by a margin equal to the number of wickets still to fall in the innings (for example, "Team B won by five wickets").</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">The third innings concludes with the team that batted twice still trailing the team that batted once. The match ends without playing a fourth innings. The team that batted only once is the winner by a margin equal to "an innings" plus the difference in aggregate run totals of the teams (for example, "Team A won by an innings and 26 runs").</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">Time for the match expires without a result being reached. This usually occurs at the end of the last day of the match. The result is a draw: there is no winner, no matter how superior the position of one of the sides. Rain causing a loss of playing time is a common factor in drawn matches, although matches may be drawn even without interference from the weather: usually as a result of poor time management or an intentional effort on the part of one team to avoid losing.</p>

		<div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12">
		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">The match is abandoned because the ground is declared unfit for play. This has occurred three times, resulting each time in a draw being declared: England v Australia at Headingley, Leeds, 1975 (vandalism); West Indies v England at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica, 1998 (dangerous ground);West Indies v England at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua, 2009 (dangerous ground).</p>

		<p style="test-align:center; font-size:25px; color:green;font-family:myfont; src:url(LCALLIG.ttf)">The match is awarded through a forfeiture. If a team refuses to take the field of play, the umpires may award the match to the opposing team.[37] This has only happened once in Test cricket, in the 2006 fourth Test between England and Pakistan.</p>
